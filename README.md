#1.
Continuously read the joystick, and display a number in binary on the bottom four LEDs that indicates the direction of the joystick (1 for North, 2 for East, 3 for South, 4 for West, 0 for no direction) and turn on LED 5 if (and only if) the joystick is pressed in.
#2.
Continuously readvalues from the ADC and print them out the serial port.
#3.
Toggle the top LED on or off each time the pushbutton is pressed and released. So each sequence of button press, button release should change the LED from off to on or from on to off.
