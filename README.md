# Real Time Operating Systems
## Explanation
- [This file](https://github.com/arjun-krishna1/real-time-operating-systems/blob/7bb7a763044e05654b6f74e2de5626a4be683ec4/lab5/src/general.c) contains code we wrote to implement a [fault tolerance algorithm](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6410/2016fa/slides/17-distributed-systems-byzantine-agreement.pdf) (the Oral Majority Algorithm)
- We used Message Queues, Semaphores, and Mutexes to run our code on multiple threads
- Written in C using the CMSIS-RTOS2 interface for real time operating system programming
